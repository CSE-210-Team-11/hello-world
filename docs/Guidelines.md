# Best Practices

Here's a summary of best practices that we have learned so far:
* Don't commit your code directly to the main branch. (It's blocked any way!)
* Ensure that you have an issue that covers the piece of code you're working on (it can have a broader context than just the feature that's been worked upon!).
* The commit number MUST be included in the commit message.
* Don't review a pull request for the sake of it, the reviewer is equally responsible for the code that's being pushed to main.
