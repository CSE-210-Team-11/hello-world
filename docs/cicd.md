# Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline Status
## Overview
This document provides the current status of the CI pipeline, detailing its functionality, components, and ongoing/planned developments. The pipeline is designed to validate pull requests (PRs) efficiently by running essential checks and tests before merging into the `main` branch.
---
## Current Status
### Functional Features
- **Triggering Workflow**:
  - Automatically triggers on pull requests targeting the `main` branch.
  
- **Environment Setup**:
  - Installs Node.js 20, ensuring compatibility with modern runtime features.
  - Implements npm caching to speed up dependency installation.
  - Configures Node.js with latest ECMAScript features support
  
- **Dependency Installation**:
  - Executes `npm install` to fetch and prepare project dependencies.
  - Verifies compatibility of installed packages
  - Handles both production and development dependencies

- **Biome Checks**:
  - Runs Biome lint and format checks separately to ensure code adheres to the project's coding standards.
  - Configured with specific rule exemptions for `style/noParameterAssign` and `suspicious/noAssignInExpressions`
  - Supports automatic code formatting and linting fixes
  
- **Test Execution**:
  - Executes `npm test` to validate unit and integration test cases, ensuring code correctness.
  - Utilizes Jest testing framework with JSDOM environment
  - Generates comprehensive test coverage reports
  
- **Error Tracking**:
  - Separates Biome checks and test execution for improved error isolation and faster debugging.
  - Provides detailed error logs and coverage information

## Planned Improvements
- **Enhanced Test Coverage**:
  - Expand unit tests to include edge cases and integration scenarios.
  - Implement E2E (End-to-End) testing workflows.
  - Gradually reduce custom rule exemptions in Biome configuration
  
- **Dynamic Dependency Caching**:
  - Optimize dependency caching to better handle version updates.
  - Implement automated dependency vulnerability scanning
  
- **Parallelization**:
  - Run Biome checks and tests in parallel to reduce execution time.
  - Improve overall CI/CD pipeline performance
  
- **Code Coverage Thresholds**:
  - Introduce thresholds for minimum code coverage to maintain quality.
  - Set initial target of 70% code coverage
  
- **Notification Integration**:
  - Notify developers of CI results via Slack or email for immediate feedback.
  - Provide detailed reports on test results, coverage, and potential issues

## Recommended CI Pipeline Configuration
- **Node.js Version**:
  - Use Node.js 20.x LTS
  - Ensure compatibility with project's ECMAScript requirements

- **Dependency Management**:
  - Implement npm caching strategy
  - Verify dependency installation before testing
  - Use `npm ci` for clean, reproducible builds

- **Pipeline Stages**:
  1. Dependency Installation
     - Run `npm install` or `npm ci`
     - Cache dependencies to improve performance
  
  2. Linting
     - Execute Biome linting checks
     - Run `npm run lint`
     - Prevent merging if linting errors exist
  
  3. Code Formatting
     - Run Biome format checks
     - Execute `npm run format`
     - Ensure consistent code style

  4. Unit Testing
     - Run Jest test suite
     - Execute `npm test`
     - Generate coverage report

  5. Coverage Validation
     - Check minimum coverage thresholds
     - Initial target: 70% code coverage
     - Block merge if coverage falls below threshold

- **Error Handling**:
  - Fail pipeline on:
    * Linting errors
    * Test failures
    * Coverage below threshold
  - Provide clear, actionable feedback

- **Recommended Tools**:
  - CI/CD Platform: GitHub Actions (recommended)
  - Linting: Biome
  - Testing: Jest
  - Coverage: Jest Coverage
  - Notification: Slack/Email integrations
