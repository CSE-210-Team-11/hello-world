# Code Quality Tool Selection

## Context and Problem Statement

We need a modern, efficient code quality solution for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that combines linting and formatting in one tool. While tool maturity is important, we prioritize performance, unified configuration, and modern development experience.

## Decision Drivers

* Performance and efficiency
* Single configuration for all file types
* Modern JavaScript features support
* Ease of setup and maintenance
* CI/CD integration capabilities
* Developer experience
* Future-proof architecture
* Resource consumption
* Build time impact

## Considered Options

* [Biome] - Modern, all-in-one JavaScript toolchain
* [ESLint + Stylelint + HTMLHint + Prettier] - Traditional combined tools approach
* [StandardJS + Stylelint] - Zero-config approach

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Biome", because it provides a unified, high-performance solution that simplifies our toolchain while offering modern features and an excellent developer experience.

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
To address the tool's relative newness:
1. Regular version pinning
2. Comprehensive internal documentation
3. Backup plan using traditional tools if needed

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Biome
* Good, because it's significantly faster than traditional tools
* Good, because it has a single, unified configuration
* Good, because it replaces multiple tools (formatter + linters)
* Good, because it has low resource consumption
* Good, because it provides immediate feedback
* Good, because it has growing community support
* Good, because it's built with modern JavaScript in mind
* Neutral, because documentation is good but still growing
* Bad, because it's relatively new in production environments
* Bad, because it has fewer third-party plugins
* Bad, because some advanced configurations are limited

### StandardJS + Stylelint
* Good, because it has zero JavaScript configuration needed
* Good, because it enforces consistent JavaScript style across all projects
* Good, because it has automatic formatting for JavaScript
* Good, because it has strong opinions that prevent style debates
* Good, because Stylelint handles CSS with extensive capabilities
* Good, because both tools are well-established and stable
* Good, because it has excellent documentation and community support
* Good, because it's widely used in open source projects
* Bad, because Standard's rules cannot be modified
* Bad, because it doesn't handle HTML linting
* Bad, because it requires separate HTML tooling
* Bad, because Standard's opinions might conflict with team preferences
* Bad, because it needs additional setup for TypeScript
* Bad, because it requires two separate tool configurations
* Bad, because style rules can't be gradually adopted
* Bad, because some Standard rules are controversial

### ESLint + Stylelint + HTMLHint + Prettier
* Good, because they're battle-tested
* Good, because they have extensive documentation
* Good, because they have large plugin ecosystems
* Bad, because they require multiple configurations
* Bad, because they're slower than unified solutions
* Bad, because they consume more resources
* Bad, because they have potential tool conflicts

## Success Metrics

1. Performance:
   - Build time reduction
   - CI pipeline speed
   - Developer machine resource usage

2. Developer Experience:
   - Setup time
   - Configuration maintenance time
   - Issue resolution time

3. Code Quality:
   - Number of style-related PR comments
   - Consistency across codebase
   - Build failures due to quality issues
