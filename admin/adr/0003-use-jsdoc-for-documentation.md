# Documentation Generator Selection

## Context and Problem Statement

Our JavaScript codebase needs standardized, maintainable documentation that integrates with our development workflow. We face several challenges:
- Inconsistent documentation practices across teams
- Lack of automated documentation generation
- Need for better IDE integration and developer tooling support
- Difficulty maintaining documentation alongside code changes
- Requirements for both API documentation and internal code documentation

## Decision Drivers

* **Developer Workflow Integration** - Documentation should be written close to the code and be part of the regular development process
* **IDE Support** - Tool should provide good editor integration with features like autocomplete and inline documentation
* **Maintenance** - Documentation should be easy to maintain and automatically validate
* **JavaScript Ecosystem Fit** - Native support for modern JavaScript features and common patterns
* **Learning Curve** - Tool should be easy to adopt and have good community resources
* **Generation Features** - Ability to generate readable HTML documentation for team use

## Considered Options

* [JSDoc] - A straightforward tool for generating structured JavaScript documentation.
* [Docco] - Creates simple, side-by-side code and comment documentation for easy reading.
* [Sphinx] - A powerful, customizable documentation tool for complex, multi-language projects.
